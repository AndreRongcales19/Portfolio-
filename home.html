        <p>Hello, I am Hubert Andre Rongcales, and I am 19 years old and born in the Philippines. Playing games is one of my biggest hobbies, but I also play a lot of sports like volleyball, basketball, and lifting. Ever since my youthhood, I have been exposed to games like Counter-Strike or Dota. Years later, I went to the Netherlands to live here and to continue my studies. Living in the Netherlands made me realize that there are lots of opportunities given to me, and therefore I pursued my dream to hopefully become a programmer.</p>
